# RAM Blackwater TCP
This is a skin pack containing the following 3 skins:

    Sona from Kissy Cutie (over Aphid)
    Umi the Umriss Girl (over Router)
    Lizzy the Azzypants Fujoshi (over Tachi)

All of these are available to equip as soon as the mod is installed, without any unlock requirements.

## Dependencies
This mod depends on [RAModding-VRAM](https://github.com/BlackwaterMenace/RAModding-VRAM).

## Special Thanks
Thanks to Andrew, Toby, and all of the other RAM developers at Xylem Studios for making RAM. 10/10, my only complaint is that it should have costed more money.
Thanks to MerengueMori and the rest of Xocolatl Games for making Kissy Cutie, and for making Sona. That game was truly an experience to witness, and I am glad to have been there to see it.
Thanks to Pij, Mel, ExcessiveClownery, and the rest of the Azzypants thread for making Umi and Lizzy. These two have lived rent-free in my mind since their inception, and I absolutely adore them - both ironically and unironically.
Thanks to everyone who has ever written an Umrizzypants fic. It is because of you that I was possessed to make this, my first sprite art project.
And of course, thanks to you for reading this far. If you use this mod, I hope you enjoy it.
